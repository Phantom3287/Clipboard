I have uploaded the files of app on my google drive because its size is more than 100 mb so it can't be uploaded on github.
My project is on apple's universal clipboard   which is for non ios devices or across all type of devices.
I have used javascript nodejs express js and java
for the setup we have to first run app once in phone , then let remain open in background
and for the computer you have to just open the website on any browser.
